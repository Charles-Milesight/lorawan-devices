Its small size, battery power supply, and wide data transmission range allow the device to be used virtually anywhere. Additionally, it comes in two enclosure types one for indoor use (material ABS) and another for outdoor use (epoxy resin). It is equipped with a lithium battery with a very low level of self-discharge, allowing data to be collected for years.","dimensions":{"diameter":47,"height":13,"length":0,"width":0},"draft":false,"firmwareversions":[{"hardwareVersions":["1.3"],"numeric":1,"profiles":{"AU915-928":{"codec":"","id":"yo-360-profile-au","lorawanCertified":true},"EU863-870":{"codec":"","id":"yo-360-profile","lorawanCertified":true},"US902-928":{"codec":"","id":"yo-360-profile-us","lorawanCertified":true}},"version":"3.1.0"}],"hardwareversions":[{"numeric":1,"partNumber":"","version":"1.3"}],"ipcode":"IP67","iscjklanguage":false,"modelid":"yo-360","name":"YO 360","operatingconditions":null,"outputs":[{"mediaType":"text/html","name":"HTML","path":"","baseName":"index","rel":"canonical","protocol":"","isPlainText":false,"isHTML":true,"noUgly":false,"notAlternative":false,"permalinkable":true,"weight":10},{"mediaType":"application/json","name":"JSON","path":"","baseName":"index","rel":"alternate","protocol":"","isPlainText":true,"isHTML":false,"noUgly":false,"notAlternative":false,"permalinkable":false,"weight":0}],"photos":{"main":"yo-360.png","other":[]},"producturl":"https://yosensi.io/products/yo_360/","resellerurls":[],"sensors":["accelerometer","temperature","humidity"],"tags":["accelerometer","temperature","humidity","IP67","AU915-928","EU863-870","US902-928"],"title":"YO 360","vendor":{"description":"","email":"","enddevices":["yo-pure-pro","yo-temp","yo-power","yo-360","yo-agribox","yo-modbus","yo-distance","yo-analog","yo-airflow-pro","yo-meter-pulse","yo-pulse","yo-refrigerant-monitor","yo-h2o"],"id":"yosensi","name":"Yosensi Sp. z o.o.","title":"","vendorid":659,"website":""},"video":"","videos":null,"weight":18}
